## Motivation:
#### Working with Quasar CLI has been a game changer for my development and deployment work flow. This README documents the deployment of a Quasar SSR build on DigitalOcean using PM2 and NGINX.
## Star Power:sparkles:
#### If you like this guide please star :star: the repo. Every star :dizzy: sends me a little ray of sunshine :sun_with_face: that I use to power :zap: my home :tent: and computer :computer:.
## :floppy_disk: Developer Accessibility Statement:
#### :crystal_ball: I see great success in your future.  Believe in yourself and you will achieve anything. Quasar makes it easy to develop cross platform applications from a single code base. 
#### :broken_heart: Anyone can experience burn out when learning a new technology. If you face an error during installation or deployment, don't sweat :sweat: it!
#### :gift_heart: Always remember there are Quasarians worldwide :earth_americas: ready to help you.
